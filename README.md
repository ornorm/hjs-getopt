# HJS-GETOPT
> This is a JS port of GNU getopt, a class for parsing command line arguments passed to programs. It it based on the C
 getopt() functions in glibc 2.0.6 and should parse options in a 100% compatible manner. If it does not, that is a 
 bug. The programmer's interface is also very compatible...

Some command classes: LongOpt, Getopt.

## Installation

Node:

```sh
npm install hjs-getopt --save
```
